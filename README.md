# Crypto App
This app was created with the purpose of showcasing my skills with Reactjs 
I made it using CoinRanking Api from Rapid Api
I was able to pull data from the api and use it with React components 
the Api gives me the oportunity to use real data from the same day 
but is not live 

React App created with create-react-app 
only displays 50 crypto currency coins and its able to 
filter which coin the user wants to know about 
so far it only does that but it has room to improve 

feel free to let me know where I could improve or what else should
I try to implement in this app.
